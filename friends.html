<p1 class=p1> In the Portal game series there is a large number of other robots. </p1>
<h1> Portal 1 </h1>
<h2> GLaDOS</h1>
<p1 class=p1> GLaDOS is the main antagonist in the original portal game.GLaDOS is responsible 
    for testing and maintenance in the Aperture Science Computer-Aided Enrichment Center in all 
    titles. While GLaDOS initially appears in the first game to simply be a voice that guides the player, 
    her words and actions become increasingly malicious as she makes her intentions clear. The second game, 
    as well as the Valve-created comic Lab Rat, reveals that she was mistreated by the scientists 
    and used a neurotoxin to kill the scientists in the laboratory before the events of Portal. She also
    created P-Body and Atlas so they can participate in her Cooperative Testing Initiative. </p1>

<h2>Sentry Turrets </h1>
<p1 class=p1>Sentry Turrets are tripod robots that appear in every game in the Portal series. They are seen as 
    incapable of independent movement, but can open each side of their chassis (their 'arms') horizontally in 
    order to reveal two gatling guns. The central part of the chassis holds their red eye, which emits a targeting laser. 
    Almost all of the space within the Turret is devoted to storing the ridiculously stacked ammo, explaining the nearly 
    infinite supply of ammo when firing.</p1>
<h1> Portal 2 </h1>
<img src='https://i1.theportalwiki.net/img/thumb/7/74/P-body.png/200px-P-body.png' id="hp" alt="P-Body"/> 
<h2> P-Body</h1>
<p1 class=p1> P-body is an orange eyed Core with a design similar to that of a Turret, and is portrayed to have somewhat 
    less masculinity than Atlas - if not a hint femininity. GLaDOS had created the Cooperative Testing Initiative after 
    her awakening in Portal 2, as a means of replacing Chell as her only Test Subject. Along with Atlas, the two bots are pitted 
    against a series of tests built by GLaDOS herself, utilizing the many different mechanics previously encountered by Chell from the
    game's single-player campaign.It was later revealed by GLaDOS that Atlas and P-body's Cores are programmed specifically to do nothing more but tests.
    (P-Body is also Atlas' Best friend!)</p1>

<img src='https://i1.theportalwiki.net/img/thumb/9/94/Wheatley.png/300px-Wheatley.png' id="hp" width=150 alt="Wheatley"/>
<h2> Wheatley</h1>
  <p1 class=p1> Wheatley is a personality core of masculin programing. He is known as the "Intelligence Dampening Sphere" as
    he was created to make GLaDOS dumber. Wheatley is the main villain of Portal 2, he takes control of the Aperture Science facillity 
    after he switches places with GLaDOS. The power becomes this character's fatal flaw as it eventualy leads to the core being ejected
    into space. Wheatley is the cause of the reawakening of GLaDOS after the events of the first Portal game. Wheatley is voiced by 
    Stephen Merchant, who's English West Country accent is very promonent in Wheatley's character. </p1>

<h1> Aperature Desk Job (non-canon) </h1>
<h2> Grady</h1>
<p1 class=p1> Grady is a personality construct developed by Aperature Science to guide new product inspectors. Grady is a cool looking
  blue sphere with an arm! Not much is known about Grady.
