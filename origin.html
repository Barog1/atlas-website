<p1 class=p1> The name of atlas comes from a titan from greek mythology with the same name. According to the ancient Greek poet Hesiod, Atlas stood at the ends of the earth 
    in extreme west. Later, he became commonly identified with the Atlas Mountains in northwest Africa and was said to be the first King of Mauretania. Atlas was said 
    to have been skilled in philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy. In antiquity, he was credited with inventing the first celestial sphere. In some texts, he is even
    credited with the invention of astronomy itself. (He was very smart!)
